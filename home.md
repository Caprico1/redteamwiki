# Red Team Wiki

## Contributing

Initially, all users will be only able to read. If you wish to contribute, you can do so one of two ways:

1. Ask to be givent the role of "Writer". You can ping any of the creators to help make that happen.
2. Submit a pull request on the Github repository: https://github.com/redteamwiki/redteamwiki - This is probably optimal for individual who only wish to contribute a spelling or grammar fix, or just one to contribute a single page of data once.
