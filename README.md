# Red Team Wiki

## Intent

This wiki's purpose is to become yet another public resource of centralized information regarding Red Team tactics and procedures. We hope to also focus on the reporting, and defensive aspects of each of the TTPs discussed herein.

## Contributing

Initially, all users will be only able to read. If you wish to contribute, you can do so one of two ways:

1. Ask to be givent the role of "Writer". You can ping any of the creators to help make that happen.
2. Submit a pull request on the Github repository: https://github.com/redteamwiki/redteamwiki - This is probably optimal for individual who only wish to contribute a spelling or grammar fix, or just one to contribute a single page of data once.
